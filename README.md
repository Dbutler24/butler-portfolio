This is my public portfolio for the course Telling Stories with Data at Carnegie Mellon University!

# About me
Hello, my name is Daria! I'm a Master of Arts Management student at CMU learning about "dataviz" (I love this bit of lingo) in the Telling Stories with Data class. My pronouns are she/her/hers. Fun fact: I'm in the double-degree MAM program at Heinz so prior to starting at CMU, I spent a year studying at the University of Bologna in Italy. I am even conversational in Italian! Before my year abroad, I graduated from NYU with a major in music theatre and doubLe minor in English Lit. and Gender & Sexuality Studies.

This class marks my first foray into this material but I'm finding it really interesting so far. I'm excited to learn all that I can before I graduate in May so tha I can be well-rounded and versatile. Post-grad I hope to work in marketing or audience/community engagement for a theatre company or other performing arts organization. Welcome to my portfolio!

# What I Hope to Learn
I hope to learn how to create effective data visualizations and gain a basic understanding of the tools that can help me!

Check back here for visualizations from class!

# Class Example 
In class, we learned how to use the tool Flourish. Here is a visualization of the positive and cumulative cases over time in King County.

# Assignment 2: Visualizing Government Debt
For a class assignment, we used the online tool Flourish to visualize Debt-to-GDP ratio around the world and over recent years. The first visualization reflects 2019 ratios and was made on the OECD website.
<iframe src="https://data.oecd.org/chart/6gMF" width="860" height="645" style="border: 0" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen="true"><a href="https://data.oecd.org/chart/6gMF" target="_blank">OECD Chart: General government debt, Total, % of GDP, Annual, 2019</a></iframe>

This second visualization was made using Flourish and shows ratios from around the world over time and expresses the data in line charts.
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/5291010"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

For the third visualization, I opted for a Grid of Column Charts as shown below, titled "Many Debt-to-GDP ratios around the world show upticks around late 2000s/early 2010s." Since the years are only shown at the very bottom of the grid, I added color blocks to represent the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s so viewers can more easily discern the different decades represented by the data. Since the 2010s is the most recent decade reflected, I made that red and made the 1990s gray since it's not as important for this visualization. I added a "%" symbol on the side so viewers understand that the ratio is expressed as a percentage.

Whereas the Grid of Line Charts conveys how the ratios fluctuate over time, I feel that the Grid of Column Charts better conveys the ratios themselves since you can easily understand them by the height of the columns. It is quicker to discern how high the percentage is when represented this way. I think it's also easier to recognize common shapes among the various charts. For example, with this dataviz I could more quickly point out that many countries showed an uptick around the same time frame, hence why I named the grid as such. I think that took longer to recognize with lines than with columns.
