This is my public portfolio for the course Telling Stories with Data at Carnegie Mellon University!

# About me
Hello, my name is Daria! I'm a Master of Arts Management student at CMU learning about "dataviz" in the Telling Stories with Data class. My pronouns are she/her/hers. Fun fact: I'm in the double-degree MAM program at Heinz so prior to starting at CMU, I spent a year studying at the University of Bologna in Italy. I am even conversational in Italian! Before my year abroad, I graduated from NYU with a major in music theatre and doubLe minor in English Lit. and Gender & Sexuality Studies.

This class marks my first foray into this material but I'm finding it really interesting so far. I'm excited to learn all that I can before I graduate in May so that I can be well-rounded and versatile. Post-grad I hope to work in marketing or audience/community engagement for a theatre company or other performing arts organization. Welcome to my portfolio!

# What I Hope to Learn
I hope to learn how to create effective data visualizations and gain a basic understanding of the tools that can help me!
