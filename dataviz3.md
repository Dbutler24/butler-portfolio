# Original Data Visualization
I chose this visualization because the information it provides struck with me. The gap in access to a computer is especially pertinent during the pandemic and presents a real issue for students from lower income backgrounds. I thought that this dataviz was fairly straight forward, but I wanted to make it a little more pointed and distinguish between smartphone access and computer access, the latter of which is more important to virtual learning.

# My Solution
When I saw the above data visualization, I liked the ultimate message of the information, but felt that the visualization was a bit lackluster. There's also a sameness to it that made it harder to immediately distinguish between the computer access and the smartphone access. I wanted to convey the main point, which is the gap in computer access in relation to household income and parents' education level. However, I also wanted to keep the point that smartphone access is nearly ubiquitous in comparison, but pare down the other demographics that are shown. Furthermore, I know that I perceive proportion or percentages better when depicted vertically rather than horizontally, so I decided on a column chart as opposed to a bar chart. 

Below is the wireframe solution I came up with. I used different colors to represent computer and smartphone access and I only kept the household income and education level categories, in addition to the overall U.S. Teens as a benchmark. From my user feedback I gleaned a few pieces of important insight. One user noted that it took a little bit of time to understand all the information but ultimately they understood what it depicted and their takeaway was what I intended; that teens are more likely to have access to a smartphone than a computer. Interestingly, this user looked at this data in the context of the current state of virtual learning, that it is concerning for certain groups of teens not to have access to a computer as that is more important for school than a smartphone. Another user expressed that the visualization was overall clear, but suggested to use different colors and to perhaps fade out the U.S. Teens columns since it is merely there as a benchmark and not the primary information. Both users identified the same audience I was thinking of when working with this data. 

The feedback prompted me to adjust my visualization to two separate column charts that the user can toggle between. The first tab shows the percentage of teens who have smartphone access, while the second tab shows the percentage of teens who have computer access. Taking user feedback into account, I made the benchmark column gray. Although I had originally wanted to convey all the columns in one chart for side-by-side comparison, I actually found that toggling between the two charts makes more of an impact. When you toggle from "Smartphone" to "Computer", you can see the percentages physically drop, effectively communicating the problem. Below my wireframe are my first data visualization and final visualization.
