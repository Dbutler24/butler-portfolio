# Final Project: Parts I, II, and III
[Back to Portfolio](/README.md)

# Part I: The Idea
In my final project, I would like to show the status of media representation for AAPI (Asian American and Pacific Islanders), namely in film and television. Despite what may seem like an increase in representation on screen for people of color, data actually suggests that not all much progress has been achieved. I intend to show how AAPI representation is missing from both in front of and behind the camera in Hollywood.

Set-up: I will start off by visualizing the percentage of Asian lead roles in Hollywood compared to the U.S. Asian population. I will further the understanding of this underrepresentation by visualizing the actual population of Asian Americans in the most popular TV show cities, which all boast a higher AAPI population than the United States as a whole and much higher than the percentage of Asians in lead roles. 

Using data from my primary data source, the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, I will visualize the amount of the top 100 films that have zero Asian speaking roles, as well as the percentage of Asians who occupy director and executive roles in Hollywood. Visualizing the percentage of AAPI representation over the years will show that representation fluctuates and is not firmly proportionate to the population

Conflict: I plan to juxtapose this data with the current increase in anti-Asian hate crimes in the U.S. Although the lack of representation cannot be directly blamed for this increase in racial violence, it does reinforce the importance of visibility and inclusion of Asian Americans as part of the American fabric, not merely foreigners.

Resolution: Recent movies like "Crazy Rich Asians" and "The Farewell", both with majority Asian casts, show that there is progress in terms of diversity in Hollywood. However, there is still a long way to go, particularly with including Asian Americans in director and executive roles. I hope this data will show the severity of the lack of representation, but will encourage the audience to seek out more diverse stories, as viewership is what ultimately leads to increased visibility and representation.

# Completion of Final Project
I plan to complete the final project using shorthand. I will create visualizations using a combination flourish and infogram. 

The visualizations will be interwoven with text providing history and context, citing various articles and thought pieces on the subject.

# User Research Protocol 
My target audience for this data story is a general movie-going, media-consuming public. This audience may include Asian Americans, but this story is more geared towards a non-Asian demographic with a general interest in consuming film/tv. In terms of selecting interviewees, I thought of individuals who have an appreciation for film/tv, but do not work in the film/tv industry themselves. They represent the average movie-goer. They may consume a wide array of genres but are not necessarily film buffs or into niche genres. Three of them are white, as that group is more likely to not already be aware of this information. I did interview one Asian American though to gain another perspective - besides just my own - representing that identity.

Interview script:

1. Did you understand the data?
2. Were there any visualizations you felt were unnecessary/data that didn't need to be visualized? 
3. Were there any additional data or data visualizations you wanted to see?
4. Did the story make sense to you? Was there anything out of place?
5. Were any of the images/pics odd or distracting? 
6. Who do you think the target audience is?
7. Do you think there are any other calls to action that should be included, or did you feel moved to any other actions?
8. Do you have any other feedback, particularly visually and narratively?

Interview Findings:

User #1: 
- White woman, late twenties  
1. Yes.
2. No.
3. For the data that is written in text, perhaps put it into a more prominent box or use an infogram.
4. "The story made sense. Maybe include a transition into anti-Asian violence but it generally feels relevant."
5. No.
6. "Any consumer of media. It could speak to creators but also to consumers." 
7. "It seems very awareness-oriented. It's good that you provide resources."
8. Alternate the text and image column orientation so it's not just graphs on the right side the whole time.

User #2:
- White woman, mid-twenties
1. Yes.
2. "No, but the chart titles are a bit loaded; consider making them more objective of the data."
3. Perhaps include an example of a tokenized/stereotypical character.
4. "It made sense. The violence point feels a bit out of left field. You could introduce it sooner so it doesn't feel so abrupt."
5. Good images but you should probably include a photo of an Asian person.
6. "Young people. I don't feel like it's directed at Asians except for to support the narrative. It feels very accessible and directed to audiences, not the industry."
7. Good calls to action. Include "vote with your wallets" language. 
8. "Center some things to break up the orientation."

Additional Feedback: "Define AAPI for the audience. Also clarify what films are being included - is it just domestic films? Independent films?"

User #3:
- White male baby boomer
1. Yes.
2. "Good visuals. All of them served a purpose."
3. "Visualize more regarding anti-Asian violence."
4. No.
5. No.
6. "Movie-goers; a broad genre of movie-goers."
7. "Maybe include how I can find more content to support."
8. No.

User #4:
- Asian-American woman, mid-twenties
1. "For the most part, yeah! There was just one chart that I didn't understand, titled "A Majority of Top 100 Films Erase Asian Girls and Women." Do the bars represent movies? The Top 100 films for that year? Does "top 100" refer to the 100 highest-grossing films, or the AFI Top 100 list, or something else?"
2. No.
3. No. "A couple of times I found myself wanting a more precise idea of what the data represents. Re: '25 Years Passed Between Films With Majority Asian Casts': This is a nitpick, but I might amend this to specify "Hollywood Films." Because Asian films with majority Asian casts did end up hitting the American somewhat-mainstream (eg Train to Busan, Parasite, etc.); indie movies with majority-Asian casts also came out within this stretch of time."
4. Yes. "Great, clear, logical flow."
5. "The images were great, and I totally get the limitations. Though I will say that starting a presentation about AAPI representation with a stock photo of mostly white people is a bit funky."
6. "The general TV and movie-watching public."
7. "Maybe instead of just 'consume more media' I might encourage TV/movie watchers to support Asian representation with their $$$: buy tickets, buy movies, etc."
8. No. 

# Changes to Implement
A common piece of feedback I received was about the incorporation of anti-Asian violence. Users felt that it was relevant but a little abrupt. One user suggested tying it into the story sooner, while other suggested including more data that could help transition into it more seamlessly. I plan to try and find more data on the types of problematic representation that leads to this xenophobic mentality that will create a better bridge to that data point. I will also show the actual numbers of hate crimes in addition to just the percentage increase.

Further, based on frequent feedback, I will adjust the language in my first call to action to encourage consumers to "vote with their dollar" - buy tickets to these movies, etc. In the second call to action, I will include a link to a resource people can use to find more of this content.
A couple users noted that they wanted more clarity on what kinds of films were included in this study. I will clarify that this refers to domestic Hollywood films; it does not include Asian-made movies (which do, naturally, depict more Asians on-screen). 

One user felt that the chart titles were too "loaded" while another peer said that the chart titles felt appropriate. No other users commented on the chart titles either way. I will revisit these and perhaps condense a few, but I feel generally content with them.

# Target Audience and Changes Made to Final Story
Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.  Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process. (Part III)

For my final data story, the target audience is a the average movie-goer/media consumer. Based on findings from my user research, I have narrowed down this audience to a predominantly non-Asian demographic with a general interest in movies and television. As one of my users said, this story could resonate with creators/fimmakers, but most users, and I, felt that it's catered more towards the consumer. 

I wanted to include a better transition into my final point about the rise in anti-Asian violence, which was feedback I received from users and peers. I struggled to find specific numbers on the amount of representation that is offensive or problematic, so instead I included a list of problematic Asian portrayals and common tropes/stereotypes so the audience at least has some idea of what this kind of negative representation might look like in media. I also included a couple of quotes from Asian-Americans on representation and the violence, specifically. I think this will help create a bridge to that final visualization. 

In addition, I chose to visualize the increase in anti-Asian violence differently in the final version. Instead of using a scorecard to state the 
"1900% increase" statistic, I visualized the increase in incident reports that the organization Stop AAPI Hate  received in 2020. Based on feedback to show the values instead of the percentage, I depicted the increase to at least 3000 incident reports, up from approximately 100 in previous years. 

Furthermore, I clarified for the audience that this data story is focusing on U.S. domestic film and TV, exclusively. This needed to be specified because film and TV made in Asia, for example, would naturally include more Asian representation. It was unclear to one user what exactly this story was measuring. 

I also tried visualizing the line graph on Asian Directors differently because I received feedback that the dip was distracting. However, there was no way around that dip. I addressed this in the text below, however, to clarify that there were simply no Asian directors in the top 100 grossing films that year, and not that there was any data missing. 

I received several pieces of feedback regarding the calls to action, so I clarified that viewers should "vote with their dollar" and give money to AAPI stories if they want to see more representation on screen. I included several lists of content that the viewer can check out. 

Visually, I added and changed some images. I tweaked the orientation of some of the text and visualizations and added spacers so that there wouldn't be so much information clumped together.
