# Final Project: Part II

# User Research Protocol 
My target audience for this data story is a general movie-going, TV-watching public. It may include Asian Americans but is more geared towars non-Asians who consume media. The individuals that I chose to interview fit that demographic as they show an interest in media more generally. They may consume a wide array of genres but are not necessarily film buffs or into niche genres. Three of them are white and one is Asian American.

Interview script:

1. Did you understand the data?
2. Were there any visualizations you felt were unnecessary/data that didn't need to be visualized? 
3. Were there any additional data or data visualizations you wanted to see?
4. Did the story make sense to you? Was there anything out of place?
5. Were any of the images/pics odd or distracting? 
6. Who do you think the target audience is?
7. Do you think there are any other calls to action that should be included or did you feel moved to any other actions?
8. Do you have any other feedback, particularly visually and narratively?

Interview Findings:

User #1: 
- White woman, late twenties  
1. Yes.
2. No.
3. For the data that is written in text, perhaps put it into a more prominent box or use an infogram.
4. The story made sense. Include a transition into anti-Asian violence but it generally feels relevant.
5. No.
6. Any consumer of media. It could speak to creators but also to consumers. 
7. It seems very awareness-oriented. It's good that you provide resources.
8. Alternate the text and image column orientation so it's not just graphs on the right side the whole time.

User #2:
- White woman, mid-twenties
1. Yes.
2. "No, but the chart titles are a bit loaded; consider making them more objective of the data."
3. Perhaps include an example of a tokenized/stereotypical character.
4. "It made sense. The violence point feels a bit out of left field. You could introduce it sooner so it doesn't feel so abrupt."
5. Good images but you should probably include a photo of an Asian person.
6. "Young people. I don't feel like it's directed at Asians except for to support the narrative. It feels very accessible and directed to audiences, not the industry."
7. Good calls to action. Include "vote with you wallets" language. 
8. "Center some things to break up the orientation."

Additional Feedback: "Define AAPI for the audience. Also clarify what films are being included - is it just domestic films? Independent films?"

User #3:
- White male baby boomer
1. Yes.
2. "Good visuals. All of them served a purpose."
3. "Visualize more regarding anti-Asian violence."
4. No.
5. No.
6. "Movie-goers; a broad genre of movie-goers."
7. "Maybe include how I can find more content to support."
8. No.

User #4:
- Asian-American woman, mid-twenties
1. "For the most part, yeah! There was just one chart that I didn't understand, titled "A Majority of Top 100 Films Erase Asian Girls and Women." Do the bars represent movies? The Top 100 films for that year? Does "top 100" refer to the 100 highest-grossing films, or the AFI Top 100 list, or something else?"
2. No.
3. No. "A couple of times I found myself wanting a more precise idea of what the data represents. Re: '25 Years Passed Between Films With Majority Asian Casts': This is a nitpick, but I might amend this to specify "Hollywood Films." Because Asian films with majority Asian casts did end up hitting the American somewhat-mainstream (eg Train to Busan, Parasite, etc.); indie movies with majority-Asian casts also came out within this stretch of time."
4. Yes. "Great, clear, logical flow."
5. "The images were great, and I totally get the limitations. Though I will say that starting a presentation about AAPI representation with a stock photo of mostly white people is a bit funky."
6. "The general TV and movie-watching public."
7. "Maybe instead of just "consume more media" I might encourage TV/movie watchers to support Asian representation with their $$$: buy tickets, buy movies, etc."
8. No.
