# Assignment 2: Visualizing Government Debt
[Back to Portfolio](/README.md)

For a class assignment, we used the online tool Flourish to visualize Debt-to-GDP ratio around the world and over recent years. The first visualization reflects 2019 ratios and was made on the OECD website.

This second visualization was made using Flourish and shows ratios from around the world over time and expresses the data in line charts.

For the third visualization, I opted for a Grid of Column Charts as shown below, titled "Many Debt-to-GDP ratios around the world show upticks around late 2000s/early 2010s." I thought that the blocks of color from the columns would reveal something different about the data than mere lines. I chose the grid so I could still see this across all the countries listed. 
Since the years are only shown at the very bottom of the grid, I added color blocks to represent the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s so viewers can more easily discern the different decades represented by the data. Since the 2010s is the most recent decade reflected, I made that red and made the 1990s gray since it's not as important for this visualization. I added a "%" symbol on the side so viewers understand that the ratio is expressed as a percentage.

Whereas the Grid of Line Charts conveys how the ratios fluctuate over time, I feel that the Grid of Column Charts better conveys the ratios themselves since you can easily understand them by the height of the columns. It is quicker to discern how high the percentage is when represented this way. I think it's also easier to recognize common shapes among the various charts. For example, with this dataviz I could more quickly point out that many countries showed an uptick around the same time frame, hence why I named the grid as such. I think that took longer to recognize with lines than with columns.
